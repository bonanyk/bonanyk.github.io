            <h1>Resources</h1>
            
            <p>Below  I have listed some of the great sources that professionals in any industry can utilize, as well as some publishing-specific resources.</p>
            
            <a class="resources" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank"> 
                     <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/LinkedIn_logo_initials.png" alt="LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn"/>
                    </a>
            <p>One of the first steps of becoming a successful professional, no matter in what industry, a professional online presence is a must. One of the best places to establish a professional presence is <a class="inline" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, a professional social networking site. LinkedIn offers their users the ability to connect with friends and colleagues in a professional setting, which facilitates networking. LinkedIn offers you a place to post your resume, skills, and have your colleagues endorse your skills. Overall, LinkedIn is a great resource when it comes to having a professional presence online.</p>

            </a>
            
            <p>Another great professional networking site is <a class="inline" href="http://www.tyba.com" target="_blank">Tyba</a>.

                <p>One of the best resources for those interested in the publishing industry specifically is<em>Publisher's Weekly</em>.<em><a class="inline" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/email-subscriptions/index.html" target="_blank">Publisher’s Weekly</a></em> is a weekly magazine that focuses on all aspects of the international publishing industry. Its targeted audiences are publishers, authors, literary agents, librarians, booksellers, and the media. The main goal is to disseminate information regarding the latest trends in the book world and to keep everyone on the same page. Although it is a magazine, you can receive the information via e-mail as a newsletter. The magazine focuses on distributing some ‘insider’ type information on a daily basis. Now, if you’re looking on pursuing a career in the publishing industry like me, this is an excellent resource. Not only does Publisher’s Weekly distribute a whole bunch of general information, but it also will publish very specific genre material. At least for me, with a focus on children’s literature, this is a HUGE plus. Besides this, the magazine is completely free, and it has job postings. For more information about the perks of <em>Publisher's Weekly</em>, check out my <a class="inline" href="http://http://kathleenbonany.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/tips-and-tricks-publishers-weekly-a-guide-to-success/">blog post</a> about it!</p>

            <p><a class="inline" href="http://www.bookjobs.com" target="_blank">Bookjobs</a> is an online career board which advertises jobs and internships for those interested in a career in publishing. Their online statement says, "Whoever you are, whatever your background, and whatever your interests, publishing has a place for you! Publishing is about business, design, editorial, marketing, sales, and technology. Publishing is a career that makes you proud. Discover a career in an environment where you can learn, grow, succeed, and belong. A place where real people, from all walks of life, can contribute their intelligence, ideas, and experiences. In a field based on exploring and expressing new viewpoints and different ideas, the publishing industry depends upon the rich and varied backgrounds of the people who work within it." Not only are they right, but Bookjobs is an<em>amazing</em>place to find internships in the publishing world as an undergraduate student. </p>
