            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>A Work In Progress</h2>
            
            <p>I’m a Junior at the University of Florida studying English (focusing in children's literature) and Telecommunication: Media and Society, and I will be graduating in May 2015 with a BA and BS, respectively. A member of the University of Florida Pride of the Sunshine Marching Band, I have become an avid fan of college football. I’m in love with books, animals, reading, and a good cup of tea. I plan on pursuing my dream career of publishing after graduation, and through it I hope that I can help spread my love of books and reading to others!</p>
            <p>I have recently been accepted into the University Scholars Program at UF. The University Scholars Program focuses on valuable insight into how new knowledge is created and how existing knowledge is focused. The program is open to all colleges and all majors, which allows for a lot of different research to be completed. This research is culminated into a paper and a presentation that is presented at the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference, which is open to all students. My research project is focused in children's literature. I'm so excited for this opportunity and I can't wait to start working on my project!</p>

            <p>On a completely unrelated note, I avidly believe in a glass half-full perspective and I love to cheer people up. So, if you could use a little cheering up, check out Alex Day's <em>Good Morning Sunshine</em>  music video!</p>
