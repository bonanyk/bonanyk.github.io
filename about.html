            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>A Work In Progress</h2>
            
            <p>I’m a recent graduate of  the University of Florida who studied English (focusing in children's literature) and Telecommunication: Media and Society. I graduated in May with Summa Cum Laude honors in my English degree, and Cum Laude honors in my Telecommunications degree. I have become an avid fan of college football due to my four years as a member of the University of Florida Pride of the Sunshine Marching Band. I’m in love with books, animals, reading, and a good cup of tea. I am pursuing my dream career of publishing, currently by attending New York University's intense six-week Summer Publishing Institute. Through my career I hope that I can help spread my love of books and reading to others!</p>
            <p>Not only have I focused on my professional goals, I have also pursued academic research through a few different avenues at the University of Florida. In March of 2014, I was accepted into the University Scholars Program at UF. The University Scholars Program focuses on valuable insight into how new knowledge is created and how existing knowledge is focused. The program is open to all colleges and all majors, which allows for a wide variety of research to be completed. This research is culminated into a paper and a presentation that is presented at the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference, which is open to all students. </p>
            <p>I also completed a 54-page thesis on Children's Literature to complete my English degree. I specifically examine the themes of slavery and the Other in J.K. Rowling's <emphasis>Harry Potter</emphasis> series and how it may impact her readers.</p>
